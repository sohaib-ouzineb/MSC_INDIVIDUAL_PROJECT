# MSC_Individual_Project

MSC individual Project : dynamic network segmentation for cyberdefence

We developed a novel and general AI-based framework that gives the best network segmentation with respect to several metrics such as the risk, performance, resilience, and distance with a baseline architecture, with adjustable weights. Other metrics can be also be easilty specified by the user. 

Instructions are present in the jupyter notebook and in the report in the user guide chapter in the Appendix.

This framework requires the following libraries : networkx, graphillion, algorithmx, svglib, scikit-network, qdpy, deap, and scikit-learn
