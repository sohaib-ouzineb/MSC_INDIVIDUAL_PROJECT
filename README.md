MSC individual Project : dynamic network segmentation for cyberdefence

The objective of this thesis is to propose a framework that gives the best network architecture in terms of performance and security while respecting certain conditions.

Achieved tasks : 

- General Network and Enclave modellings that include reconnaissance, updates, multi-level IDS, device values...
- Extended the state of the art by modelling targeted and untargeted attacks via availability and information disclosure attacks.
- Use the MAP-Elites algorithm to optimise the network architecture with respect to a loss function measuring the risk with a penalty term to also consider network performance.

To do :

- Model degree and edge constraints on the network model.
- Refine the modelling with more defensive procedures inspired from real network architectures.
- Model a larger class of threats.
- Implement a coevolutionary algorithm.
- Implement a dynamic framework to make the network mutate as the attacker is spreading.
